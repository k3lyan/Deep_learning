# Deep_learning
Deep learning from scratch: every deep learning engineer should have a good understanding on how deep learning works. One must understand it from the mathematical background. 

A good introduction to deep learning is Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville's book, that you can find here:
https://www.deeplearningbook.org/

As your general uderstanding grows, you must be interested as going deeper into some specific topics tackled by deep learning. Here are some fundamental research articles I suggest:
